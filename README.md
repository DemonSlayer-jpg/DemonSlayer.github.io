I am a 12 year old middle school kid that has many interests such as swimming, video games, and math.
First, I love swimming because ever since my parents convinced me to swim i have loved and enjoyed it 
up to this moment with no regret. I also like video games which I would consider that I am good at because
of how much I play. I love doing math at school because I went to a extra math curriculum(very annoying) but
since I did the extra math I got good at it and everything became easy which made doing math fun for me.
